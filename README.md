# Predicting Years of Education with step AIC

This code uses the stepAIC function in R in order to find the best linear regression model to determine the number of years of education a person has received basedo on various inputs in a multiple linear regression model. After the stepAIC is run the signifiance level of all the predictors is determined and it eliminates certain predictors of the model. The number of years of education a person has received might be useful in predicting whether or not a person has been through college and thereby determine eligibiilty for further education

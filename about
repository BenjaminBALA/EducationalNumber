I ran a stepwise AIC code on an educational number prediction to predict the number of years of education for a given adult based on various input variables. I found the model that perfectly fits the data based on the stepwise selection. Since the adjusted R^2 of the model was a perfect 1 on the training data, I knew that this model was overfit to the data. I ran other models to see what would be a good fit with less parameters and more interpretability. I found some with a medium level R^2, but nothing that was a good combination of predictability as well as interpretable. 

This is a sign that with certain measures, you can perfectly fit the training data, but you will have an overfit model to the data. You need a model that has a low number of parameters for interpretability, but a high R^2
